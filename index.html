            <h6>As one of the key pillars of lifestyle medicine, healthful eating has the power to help prevent, treat, and even reverse many chronic diseases. Yet, most clinicians do not receive education on food as medicine. This course will educate and equip clinicians with knowledge of dietary patterns shown to prevent, treat, and reverse diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers as well as prepare them to implement food as medicine at a practical level in patient care.</h6> 
            <h6>The course will also include nutrition considerations for various lifecycle stages and special populations, nutrition and scope of practice, and pharmaceutical implications in food as medicine practice.</h6>
